        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Those great big fluffy clouds. All kinds of happy little splashes. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We don't have anything but happy trees here</p>
        <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Working it up and down, back and forth. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>
    </div>
